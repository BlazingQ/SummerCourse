Networks are a fundamental concept for modeling complex physical, technological, social, and biological systems. These intricate structures underlie everything from the internet and social interactions to biological pathways and transportation networks. This course, “**Modelling and Analysis of Complex Networks**”, delves into the heart of this interconnected world.

**Why Complex Networks Matter**: Complex networks serve as the backbone of modern science and technology. They reveal hidden patterns, emergent behaviors, and vulnerabilities. By studying them, we gain insights into social dynamics, disease propagation, and even the resilience of power grids. 

**The Excitement of Graph Analysis and Machine Learning**: Imagine unraveling the intricate web of connections—the nodes representing people, genes, or web pages, and the edges signifying relationships or interactions. When we perform network analysis, we will witness the beauty of interconnectedness. Moreover, applying machine learning to graph data opens doors to personalized recommendations, fraud detection, and understanding cascading effects.
